# Wedding-Website

This was a personal project that I decied to build as my own wedding is coming up soon. As a person who is still lerning, it was deffienlty a challange for me, but one i looked forward to building. This is also my fist full scale site that I am building. 

Before I built this: 
  I knew a little bit of HTML and Css as well as some basic bootstrap. I knew going into it I would have to learn as I go but   it was well worth it. 
  
Problems I came accross and how I overcame them: 

There were many problems as most site have when builing them, but with the help of a firend and google I figured them out. Some of the bigger problems are follows:  
  
    Frist off is this is the first full page working site ive built from scratch. To figure out how to start I drew a scetch of what I wanted the final outcome to look like. 
    
    The countdown timer was probaly one of the biggest issues i had because i had really no exsperience with JavaScript before this. With alot of reading and google'ing I figured it out. Still working on how to use the DOM and make it responsive. 
    
    As well as trying to make everything responsive. Still needs work in that department.
    
Things I learned that I didnt know before:
   
   I learned how the CSS grid system works and was able to create my own grid layout and understand how it works in a layout.
   
   You should use the mobil first approach. 
   
   
Overall even though this isnt compleatly compleate i am still working on this and i have learned alot! from this.
